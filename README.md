# TalkBox
JavaFX social media frontend

Welcome to TalkBox, the (future) world's leading minimialist social media app!

TalkBox is just that - an area designed for talking, sharing thoughsts, and updating your friends on what's new!

The app is written in JavaFX and styled in CSS. The UI is designed to give users an experience they're already used to as soon as they log in.

Here is the first glimpse users will have of TalkBox's simplistic UI. It is here where they are able to update and post their statuses:

Users are even able to update their profile information, including their name and city, and validation techniques have been implemented to ensure user input is appropriate.

Users can even submit queries to the developer, allowing for their voices to be heard on anything regarding bug reports, to questions, to comments.

Validation techniques have been implemented on the query pane to ensure user input is appropriate.

User queries are sent to the console currently, with a generated ticket number and all information as included by the user.
